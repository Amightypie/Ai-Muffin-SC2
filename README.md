# Ai-Muffin-SC2
First- thanks to Steven Brown and his tutorial set for helping me get a decent start on this project (although updating them would be great :P) https://chatbotslife.com/building-a-basic-pysc2-agent-b109cde1477c

My attempts at making a bot that is able to play Starcraft 2 and actually win through the use of Machine Learning

A lot of the code you will see will be terrible, there. youve had your warning, but if you managed to look at it, any feedback would be appreciated, this is just a play around hobby project on how far/complex it can become so basically im willing to learn :D
